Deep Learning Projects: Politecnico di Milano (2021-2022)
Welcome to the repository of deep learning projects, crafted as part of the curriculum at the prestigious Politecnico di Milano for the academic year 2021-2022.

Overview:
Throughout this course, we embarked on a comprehensive journey exploring the vast realm of deep learning. The projects stored herein are a testament to our endeavor to grasp complex topics and apply them in practical scenarios.

Topics Covered:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): These specialized kinds of neural networks are designed to process data with a grid-like topology, making them perfect for tasks like image recognition and classification.

Transformer Networks: Moving beyond traditional architectures, we delved deep into transformers. Known for their self-attention mechanisms, transformers have reshaped the landscape of natural language processing and beyond.

Predictive Analysis: Harnessing the capabilities of various deep learning architectures, we ventured into predicting outcomes based on intricate patterns within vast datasets.

... and much more!

Objective:
Our goal with these projects was not merely to attain proficiency in deep learning techniques but to understand their real-world applications, challenges, and nuances. We aspire for these projects to serve as a foundation for future scholars and practitioners keen on exploring the domain of deep learning.

Acknowledgements:
We extend our gratitude to the faculty of Politecnico di Milano for their unwavering guidance and support, without which this journey into deep learning would not have been as enriching.
